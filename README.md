Everything you need to know about grievance handling system. 
Students are, often, bombarded with grievances of various kinds 
almost on a daily basis.
Grievances may be real or imaginary, valid, or invalid, genuine or 
false. They might look silly and completely baseless at times.
A grievance handling system like Institute use to receive various 
complaints from students. Complaints lodged range from Academic, 
Administrative, social and other issues relating to the student. This 
platform allows for complaints to be lodged remotely by students 
with issues relating to their registration, examination, examination 
result, computation of their Grade Point Average (GPA) and hall of 
residence complaints and thereby enhances the response time for 
the appropriate unit to resolve the addressed complaints.
